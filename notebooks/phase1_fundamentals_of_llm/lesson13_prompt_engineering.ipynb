    "# Lesson 13: ChatGPT Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our lesson on ChatGPT Prompt Engineering. In this 60-minute session, we'll explore the art and science of crafting effective prompts for ChatGPT and other large language models. We'll cover why prompts are crucial, how to write them effectively, and advanced techniques to optimize your interactions with AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Understand the importance of prompts in AI interactions\n",
    "2. Write effective prompts for various use cases\n",
    "3. Apply prompt optimization techniques\n",
    "4. Implement advanced prompting strategies like Chain of Thought and Tree of Thought\n",
