    "\n",
    "## Introduction (2 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our comprehensive course on Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications. In this brief but crucial overview, we'll explore the exciting world of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and how LLMs are paving the way towards this goal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this 12-minute session, you will:\n",
    "1. Understand the concept of AGI\n",
    "2. Recognize the importance of LLMs in the journey towards AGI\n",
    "3. Identify key skills needed for various roles in the AI era\n",
    "4. Grasp the structure and goals of this course\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is AGI? (3 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) refers to highly autonomous systems that outperform humans at most economically valuable work. Unlike narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, AGI aims to possess the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of domains, similar to human intelligence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key characteristics of AGI include:\n",
    "- Generalization: The ability to apply knowledge to new, unseen situations\n",
    "- Learning: Continuous adaptation and improvement based on new information\n",
    "- Reasoning: Logical thinking and problem-solving across diverse domains\n",
    "- Creativity: Generation of novel ideas and solutions"
