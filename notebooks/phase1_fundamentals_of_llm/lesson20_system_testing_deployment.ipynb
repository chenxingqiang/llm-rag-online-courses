    "## Introduction (2 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our final lesson on System Testing and Deployment. In this 30-minute session, we'll explore how to thoroughly test our chatbot system and deploy it to a production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Understand different types of system tests\n",
    "2. Implement basic system tests for our chatbot\n",
    "3. Set up a simple CI/CD pipeline\n",
    "4. Deploy the chatbot system to a cloud platform\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Understanding System Testing (8 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "System testing involves testing the entire integrated system to verify that it meets specified requirements. For our chatbot, we'll focus on:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Functional Testing: Ensures the system functions as expected\n",
    "2. Integration Testing: Verifies different components work together correctly\n",
    "3. Performance Testing: Checks system performance under various conditions\n",
    "4. Security Testing: Identifies potential security vulnerabilities\n",
