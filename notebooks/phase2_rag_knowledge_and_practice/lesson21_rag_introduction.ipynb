    "\n",
    "## Introduction (2 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). In this 30-minute session, we'll explore the concept of RAG, its importance in modern AI systems, and how it enhances the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will:\n",
    "1. Understand what RAG is and why it's important\n",
    "2. Recognize the role and principle of RAG in AI systems\n",
    "3. Identify the three phases of RAG\n",
    "4. Understand how RAG can solve problems in LLM applications\n",
    "5. Grasp the basic pipeline of RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What is RAG? (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. It aims to enhance the quality and accuracy of generated responses by incorporating relevant information from a knowledge base.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key points:\n",
    "- Combines generation capabilities of LLMs with retrieval of external information\n",
    "- Improves factual accuracy and reduces hallucinations\n",
    "- Allows for up-to-date information without constant model retraining\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. The Role and Principle of RAG (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Role:\n",
    "- Bridge between static LLM knowledge and dynamic, external information\n",
    "- Enhance LLM responses with specific, relevant, and up-to-date information\n",
    "\n",
    "Principle:\n",
    "1. Retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base\n",
    "2. Augment the input prompt with retrieved information\n",
    "3. Generate a response using the augmented prompt\n",

    "## 4. How RAG Solves Problems in LLM Applications (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG addresses several limitations of traditional LLMs:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Knowledge Cutoff: RAG allows access to up-to-date information without retraining\n",
    "2. Hallucinations: Reduces false information by grounding responses in retrieved facts\n",
    "3. Transparency: Provides sources for information, improving explainability\n",

    "## 5. The Pipeline of RAG (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "The RAG pipeline consists of three main components:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Embedding Model:\n",
    "   - Converts text into vector representations\n",
    "   - Used for both indexing documents and encoding queries\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Vector Database:\n",
    "   - Stores document embeddings\n",
    "   - Enables efficient similarity search\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Vector Retrieval:\n",
    "   - Finds most similar documents to the query\n",
    "   - Returns relevant information for augmentation\n",
