    "# Lesson 33: Compose Test Cases for All Public APIs\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our lesson on composing test cases for all public APIs in our RAG system. In this 60-minute session, we'll explore the importance of API testing, different types of test cases, and how to implement them for our RAG system's components.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Understand the importance of API testing in RAG systems\n",
    "2. Identify different types of test cases for API testing\n",
    "3. Write test cases for the main components of our RAG system\n",
    "4. Implement automated tests using Python and pytest\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Importance of API Testing in RAG Systems (10 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "API testing is crucial for ensuring the reliability, performance, and correctness of our RAG system. It helps us:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Verify that each component works as expected\n",
    "- Ensure proper integration between components\n",
    "- Detect errors and edge cases early in the development process\n",
    "- Maintain system stability during updates and modifications\n",
    "\n",
    "For our RAG system, we'll focus on testing the following main components:\n",
    "1. Embedding model API\n",
    "2. Vector database API\n",
    "3. Language model API\n",
    "4. RAG proxy service API\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Types of Test Cases for API Testing (10 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore different types of test cases we should consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Functional tests: Verify that the API behaves correctly for valid inputs\n",
    "2. Input validation tests: Check how the API handles invalid or unexpected inputs\n",
    "3. Performance tests: Assess the API's response time and resource usage\n",
    "4. Error handling tests: Ensure the API returns appropriate error messages\n",
    "5. Integration tests: Verify that different components work together correctly\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Writing Test Cases for RAG System Components (30 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's write test cases for each main component of our RAG system:\n",

    "For the next lesson, we'll focus on packaging our RAG system as a Docker image and deploying it to a cloud environment. This will involve containerizing our application and setting up cloud infrastructure.\n",
