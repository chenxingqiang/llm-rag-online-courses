    "\n",
    "## Introduction (5 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to our final lesson on packaging and deploying our RAG system. In this 60-minute session, we'll explore how to containerize our application using Docker, create a Conda environment, and deploy our system to a cloud platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Lesson Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:\n",
    "1. Understand the basics of Docker and containerization\n",
    "2. Create a Docker image for our RAG system\n",
    "3. Set up a Conda environment for our project\n",
    "4. Deploy the containerized application to a cloud platform\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Docker Basics (10 minutes)\n",
    "\n",
    "Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and consistent environments that package an application with all its dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key concepts:\n",
    "- Dockerfile: A script containing instructions to build a Docker image\n",
    "- Image: A lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run an application\n",
    "- Container: A runtime instance of an image\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by creating a Dockerfile for our RAG system:\n",
    "\n",
    "```dockerfile\n",
    "# Use an official Python runtime as the base image\n",
    "FROM python:3.8-slim\n",
    "\n",
    "# Set the working directory in the container\n",
    "WORKDIR /app\n",
    "\n",
    "# Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app\n",
    "COPY . /app\n",
    "\n",
    "# Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt\n",
    "RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "# Make port 5000 available to the world outside this container\n",
    "EXPOSE 5000\n",
    "\n",
    "# Define environment variable\n",
    "ENV NAME RAGSystem\n",
    "\n",
    "# Run app.py when the container launches\n",
    "CMD [\"python\", \"app.py\"]"

    "Some next steps to consider:\n",
    "1. Set up continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) for automatic updates\n",
    "2. Implement monitoring and logging for your deployed application\n",
    "3. Optimize your container for production use (e.g., using multi-stage builds)\n",
    "4. Explore other cloud platforms and serverless options\n",
